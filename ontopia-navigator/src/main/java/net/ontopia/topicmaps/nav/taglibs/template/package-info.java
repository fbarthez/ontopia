/**
<p>Provides templating tags which enable the separation of presentation and content, or to use the terminology of the Navigator, the Model from the View. These tags will be useful for information designers who can "put" data into named string blocks, as well as graphic designers, who are able to "get" these strings and place them into html templates.</p>

<p>See http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2000/jw-0915-jspweb_p.html for an article on the use of templates.</p>
