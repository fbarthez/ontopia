Ontopia uses Apache Tomcat @VERSION@ (see http://tomcat.apache.org/
for more information) as its default web container.

In order to minimize the download size of our software we have decided
to remove the original (demo) web applications which comes with the
Apache Tomcat distribution.  Please see README.txt for more
information about Apache Tomcat and where to retrieve a complete
distribution.
