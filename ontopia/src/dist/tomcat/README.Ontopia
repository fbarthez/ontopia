Ontopia's Knowledge Suite (OKS) uses Tomcat @VERSION@ (part of the Jakarta
project from the Apache Group, see http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/ for
more information) as default Servlet/JSP container.

In order to minimize the download size of our software we have decided to
remove the original (demo) web applications which comes with the Tomcat
distribution.  Please see README.txt for more information about Tomcat and
where to retrieve a complete distribution.
