<p>Provides rendering tags which assist the topicmap tags in rendering the topicmap objects which have been selected. Each of the tag has a render stringifier counterpart which provides the final string rendering.</p>

<p>Three classes, DisplayTag, ClusterTag and BlockTag work directly with topicmap tags, carrying presentation information. The topic map tags select "what" objects to display and these three tags determine "how" they are to be displayed. </p>

<p>Other tags, such as BlockRenderTag and ContainerRenderTag, provide a useful shorthand for rendering content consistently. They generally act as wrappers around lists or blocks of items.</p>
